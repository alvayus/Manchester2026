Release Notes for Previous Versions
===================================
   FrontPanel 5.3.5
     + Add Ubuntu 24.04 build target.
     + okCDeviceSettings::List now works as the documentation states.
       + The previous implementation, okCFrontPanel::ErrorCode List(okCDeviceSettingNames& names),
         will show a deprecation warning: "This function only exists for compatibility, 
         use List(std::vector<std::string>&) overload instead."
     + Fix Reset Profile window incorrectly showing for products that don't support them.
     + Correctly add the hasQuadConfigFlash = true flag to Kintex US+ products.
     + libokFrontPanel.so version and SONAME is now set properly.
       + Users should copy all of the libokFrontPanel.so files if they are moved.
       + This is backwards compatible, but not compatible in
         the other directions, i.e. programs compiled with the latest FrontPanel
         SDK won't work with the old library, even if it contains all the needed
         functions, because it doesn't have the correct name nor has the correct
         SONAME.
     + Fix another issue with old vc_redist packages and running firmware updater causing crashes.
     + Sign and notarize macOS binaries.
     + Fix icons in high DPI mode on macOS.
     + macOS sample Makefiles now build universal binaries for Apple silicon.
     + Fix UI and icons in Ubuntu.
     + Fix Device ID window incorrectly showing up when exiting the GUI FlashLoader utility.
     + Clean up outdated FrontPanel files.
     + All non-C# and MATLAB source files now use Unix EOLs.
     + Add error code page to the API reference documentation, as well as a search bar.
     + Add Python usage note to FlashRead and FlashWrite to the API Reference documenatation.
     + Fix installer opening above uninstaller in some circumstances.
     + Provide Python wheel for Windows in the Python API folder.
     + PipeTest updates.
       + Add basic statistical analysis switch 'csv [filename]'.
       + This calculates error rates, averages, min, and max rates that are then output to a CSV file.
       + Improve error reporting.
       + Add usage requirements note to usage printout.
       + Add 'c' option for clearing Reset Profiles (instead of a default, undocumented action on running with no arguments).
       + Only configure flashloader.bit when required (not when just printing usage notes)
       + Remove mt_random.cpp as it wasn't used.
     + RAMTester updates.
       + Use more reliable std::chrono::steady_clock.
       + Add time and speed reporting to read/verify and write tests.
     + QNX support and references removed.
     + All functions now set GetLastError().
     + Rename Quartus license from okAlteraLicense.dat to okIntelLicense.dat.
   FrontPanel 5.3.4
     + Fix bug regarding running older vc_redist packages on some Windows 10 machines.
     + Add Rocky Linux 8 and 9 distributions.
       + With the EOL of CentOS 7.5 and their switch to CentOS stream, we wanted to provide
         RHEL support. We chose Rocky Linux due to its binary compatibility with RHEL, and its
         popularity. You should find these targets work with RHEL 8 and 9 distributions.
     + Add Raspbian 12 (Raspberry Pi 5) arm64 distribution.
     + Improve the functionality of GetLastErrorMessage.
       + This function now returns the generic message corresponding to the last
         error returned by a FrontPanel API call, if no more detailed error message
         is available.
     + Add GetErrorMessage API call.
       + Pass this function a FrontPanel error, like Timeout, to get a human-readable message giving
    some extra information.
     + Fix XFP sounds not working on macOS.
        FrontPanel 5.3.3
     + Add XEM8305-AU15P & XEM8370-KU11P Mac & Linux assets.

     + Firmware updater visual updates.
     + Fix several cosmetic problems in dark mode.

   
   FrontPanel 5.3.0
     + FrontPanel API Changes
       + Important change to pipe timeout handling under Linux: pipe transfers using the specified timeout 
         may take slightly longer in case the timeout actually expires, i.e. the total function execution 
         time is not exactly bounded by the timeout any more, as the function still performs the required
         cleanup in this case, unlike before.

         Recommendation: in case of an error during pipe transfer, it is recommended to close the device
         as there is no guarantee that the memory used as the transfer buffer can be safely freed until
         this is done.
       + Fix segmentation fault in Linux when using timeouts a certain way, related to the above change.
       + Python 2 discontinued.
       + Many EOL software distributions discontinued.

         sending an IsFrontPanelEnabled request to the server.
       + Add HasDeviceSettingsSupport method.

       + Increment FPoIP to version 
       + Add the following methods to the FPoIP API:
           * FlashEraseSector
           * FlashWrite
           * FlashRead
           * ClearFPGAConfiguration
           * ConfigureFPGAFromMemoryWithReset
